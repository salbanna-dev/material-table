1. TLS/SSL Protocol Mismatch

Node.js 20 may not support older versions of TLS (like TLSv1.0 or TLSv1.1). If the Okta endpoint is trying to use an older version, this can lead to the EPROTO error.

Solution:
Force Node.js to use TLSv1.2 or higher by specifying it in the request options:
const https = require('https');

const options = {
  hostname: 'your-okta-endpoint',
  port: 443,
  path: '/login',
  method: 'GET',
  minVersion: 'TLSv1.2',  // Enforces TLSv1.2 or higher
};

const req = https.request(options, (res) => {
  // handle response
});

req.on('error', (e) => {
  console.error(`Problem with request: ${e.message}`);
});

req.end();
Solution:
To temporarily bypass this, set NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED to 0. This is not recommended for production environments but can help identify if the issue is related to certificate verification:

Self-Signed Certificates or Untrusted CA

If your OpenShift environment or the Okta environment uses self-signed certificates or certificates from an untrusted CA, Node.js might reject them by default.
NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 node your_app.js

3. Outdated or Weak Ciphers
Node.js 20 enforces stricter cipher suites. If the Okta endpoint is using weak or deprecated ciphers, the connection might fail with EPROTO.

Solution:
Try specifying stronger ciphers in your HTTPS request:
const https = require('https');

const options = {
  ciphers: 'TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256:TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256',  // Stronger ciphers
  minVersion: 'TLSv1.2'
};

const req = https.request('https://your-okta-endpoint', options, (res) => {
  // handle response
});

req.on('error', (e) => {
  console.error(e);
});

req.end();





Proxy or Firewall in OpenShift



If you’re running this in an OpenShift environment, ensure that your Okta connection isn’t being blocked by a proxy or firewall that enforces older TLS versions or certificates.

Solution:
Check OpenShift network policies and configurations to ensure they allow outbound connections to Okta and are not downgrading the TLS protocol.




The EPROTO error typically results from a mismatch in the TLS version, an unsupported cipher, or issues with certificates. By adjusting the TLS settings or certificates in your Node.js code, you should be able to resolve the issue. If the problem persists, double-check OpenShift’s network configurations and ensure that Okta’s endpoints are accessible and compatible with your Node.js version.






Okta JWT Token Verification

The JwtParseError error indicates that the problem might also stem from the inability to retrieve or verify the signing key (kid) from Okta. This could be due to networking issues, certificate problems, or invalid kid settings.

Solution:

	•	Ensure that your OpenShift environment has access to Okta’s public key infrastructure (PKI) to verify the JWT token’s signature. You can fetch the Okta JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint to resolve the kid.
	•	Verify that your network can reach Okta’s JWKS endpoint without any TLS handshake issues.

Example of fetching JWKS:

const axios = require('axios');

axios.get('https://your-okta-domain/oauth2/default/v1/keys')
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error fetching keys:', error);
  });





Certificate or Firewall Issues

If there are proxy servers, firewalls, or custom certificates in your OpenShift environment, these might be interfering with the TLS handshake.

Solution:

	•	If you’re using self-signed certificates or custom certificate authorities (CAs), ensure that the necessary certificates are trusted by the Node.js environment. You may need to add the certificates to your trusted CA store.
	•	Test whether disabling certificate verification temporarily helps identify the issue:



NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 node your_app.js




 TLS Settings in OpenShift

OpenShift may have policies or restrictions that enforce certain versions of TLS or specific ciphers. You can review and configure these settings as needed.

Check OpenShift’s default TLS version and ciphers:

	•	Ensure that OpenShift allows outgoing connections to Okta over the required TLS version (TLS 1.2 or higher).
	•	If your OpenShift environment enforces older or weaker ciphers, you might need to update the TLS policies for your routes or pods.
